### Hi there 👋

I'm Jon Linnell, a software engineer working in London, based in Oxford.

## 👨‍💻 What I do

I am currently part of the Engineering team at **By Miles**, a pay-per-mile car insurance company in the UK. In my role as **lead engineer** in the Platform team, I manage the team working primarily with our cloud-native telematics and policy management services, enabling all our teams to interact with our core operational business data.

My most productive work is done in **TypeScript** with **Node.js**, with which I have almost a decade of experience.

I also have a passion for **Go**, and am increasingly looking for appropriate uses for it both in my day job and my personal projects. Over the years, I've gained experience in a lot of languages and frameworks, including **Rust**, **Python**, **Perl**, **PHP**, and many forms of shell scripting. 

I have an embarassingly long relationship with Linux and *nix-style operating systems (btw i use arch) and am rarely as comfortable as when I have 4+ tmux panes open.

I am a qualified AWS Solutions Architect with several years' experience implementing cloud-native solutions that leverage AWS's cloud technology.

Recently, I've been trialling generative AI to assist with the more mundane parts of my work, with mixed success. All of my professional work is pure old-fashioned homegrown human.

## 🌱 What I'm learning

Away from the screens, I'm a human linguaphile and aspiring polyglot. I'm reasonably fluent in 🇫🇷 **French**, I'm currently studying 🇨🇳 **Mandarin Chinese** for fun at the University of Oxford, and I have varying basic levels of 🇸🇪 **Swedish**, 🇵🇱 **Polish**, and **Spanish**. I'm still working on my English.

A long-time amateur photographer, I have a NAS full of photographs of people in cities, walls, lights, and other strange urbana. You can see some [here](https://www.jonlinnell.co.uk/photography).
