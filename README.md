### Hi there 👋

I'm Jon Linnell, a product engineer based in London, UK.

🕺 He/Him

## 👨‍💻 What I'm doing

I am currently employed as a Software Development Engineer at Third Bridge Group Ltd. I work on a variety of Node/React-based projects, with involvement both in frontend and backend work, also delving into some more devops-y areas (AWS/Terraform, Docker) and serverless applications.

## 🌱 What I'm learning

I’m currently learning `go` so that people don't look at me funny when I say I love Node, and `Haskell` as an academic exercise to improve my view of software engineering.

Electronics is a recently-acquired hobby, so I've been spending plenty of time in the Arduino IDE and holding a soldering iron.

I love spoken languages — I'm  constantly working to improve my French 🇫🇷, and I'm also learning (to varying degrees of success) Polish 🇵🇱, Swedish 🇸🇪, and Spanish 🇪🇸 🇲🇽.
