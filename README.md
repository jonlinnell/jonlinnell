### Hi there 👋

I'm Jon Linnell, a fullstack software engineer with a passion for good products and user-oriented applications.

🌍 I'm currently based in London, UK, however I encourage remote working opportunities.

🕺 He/Him

## 👨‍💻 What I'm doing

I'm a Software Development Engineer at Third Bridge Group Ltd. I work on a variety of Node/React-based projects, doing both frontend and backend work, also delving into some DevOps (by way of AWS) and serverless applications.

## 🌱 What I'm learning

I’m currently learning `go` so that people don't look at me funny when I say I love Node, and `Haskell` as an academic exercise to improve my view of software engineering.

Electronics is a recently-acquired hobby, so I've been spending plenty of time in the Arduino IDE and holding a soldering iron.

I'm also constantly working to improve my French 🇫🇷.
